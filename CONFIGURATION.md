C/P legend: C = Consumer, P = Producer, * = both

Property                                 | C/P | Range              |       Default | Description
-----------------------------------------|-----|--------------------|--------------:|--------------------------
debug                                    |  *  | generic, broker, topic, metadata, feature, queue, msg, protocol, cgrp, security, fetch, interceptor, plugin, consumer, admin, eos, all | undefined | A comma-separated list of debug contexts to enable. Detailed Producer debugging: broker,topic,msg. Consumer: consumer,cgrp,topic,fetch
client_id                                |  *  |                    |       rdkafka | Client identifier
bootstrap_servers                        |  *  |                    |               | Initial list of brokers host:port separated by comma
message_max_bytes                        |  *  | 1000 .. 1000000000 |       1000000 | Maximum transmit message size.
message_copy_max_bytes                   |  *  | 0 .. 1000000000    |         65535 | Maximum size for message to be copied to buffer. Messages larger than this will be passed by reference (zero-copy) at the expense of larger iovecs
receive_message_max_bytes                |  *  | 1000 .. 2147483647 |     100000000 | Maximum Kafka protocol response message size. This serves as a safety precaution to avoid memory exhaustion in case of protocol hickups. This value must be at least `fetch_max_bytes`  + 512 to allow for protocol overhead; the value is adjusted automatically unless the configuration property is explicitly set.
max_in_flight                            |  *  | 1 .. 1000000       |       1000000 | Maximum number of in-flight requests per broker connection. This is a generic property applied to all broker communication, however it is primarily relevant to produce requests. In particular, note that other mechanisms limit the number of outstanding consumer fetch request per broker to one.
metadata_request_timeout_ms              |  *  | 10 .. 900000       |         60000 | Non-topic request timeout in milliseconds. This is for metadata requests
topic_metadata_refresh_interval_ms       |  *  | -1 .. 3600000      |        300000 | Topic metadata refresh interval in milliseconds. The metadata is automatically refreshed on error and connect. Use -1 to disable the intervalled refresh
metadata_max_age_ms                      |  *  | 1 .. 86400000      |        900000 | Metadata cache max age. Defaults to `topic_metadata_refresh_interval_ms` * 3
topic_metadata_refresh_fast_interval_ms  |  *  | 1 .. 60000         |           250 | When a topic loses its leader a new metadata request will be enqueued with this initial interval, exponentially increasing until the topic metadata has been refreshed. This is used to recover quickly from transitioning leader brokers
topic_metadata_refresh_sparse            |  *  | true, false        |          true | Sparse metadata requests (consumes less network bandwidth)
topic_blacklist                          |  *  |                    |               | Topic blacklist, a comma-separated list of regular expressions for matching topic names that should be ignored in broker metadata information as if the topics did not exist
socket_timeout_ms                        |  *  | 10 .. 300000       |         60000 | Timeout for network requests

socket_keepalive_enable                  |  *  | true, false        |         false | Enable TCP keep-alives (SO_KEEPALIVE) on broker sockets
socket_nagle_disable                     |  *  | true, false        |         false | Disable the Nagle algorithm on broker sockets (TCP_NODELAY)
socket_max_fails                         |  *  | 0 .. 1000000       |             1 | Disconnect from broker when this number of send failures (e.g., timed out requests) is reached. Disable with 0. NOTE: The connection is automatically re-established
broker_address_ttl                       |  *  | 0 .. 86400000      |          1000 | How long to cache the broker address resolving results (milliseconds)

reconnect_backoff_ms                     |  *  | 0 .. 3600000       |           100 | The initial time to wait before reconnecting to a broker after the connection has been closed. The time is increased exponentially until `reconnect.backoff.max.ms` is reached. -25% to +50% jitter is applied to each reconnect backoff. A value of 0 disables the backoff and reconnects immediately. 
reconnect_backoff_max_ms                 |  *  | 0 .. 3600000       |         10000 | The maximum time to wait before reconnecting to a broker after the connection has been closed. 
statistics_interval_ms                   |  *  | 0 .. 86400000      |             0 | Statistics emit interval. The application also needs to register a stats callback using `stats_callback` config. The granularity is 1000ms. A value of 0 disables statistics.
stats_callback                           |  *  | module or fun/2    |       undefined| A callback where stats are sent 
log_level                                |  *  | 0 .. 7             |             6 | Logging level (syslog(3) levels)
log_connection_close                     |  *  | true, false        |          true | Log broker disconnects. It might be useful to turn this off when interacting with 0.9 brokers with an aggressive `connection_max_idle_ms` value.
api_version_request                      |  *  | true, false        |         false | Request broker's supported API versions to adjust functionality to available protocol features. If set to false, or the ApiVersionRequest fails, the fallback version `broker_version_fallback` will be used. **NOTE**: Depends on broker version >=0.10.0. If the request is not supported by (an older) broker the `broker_version_fallback` fallback is used
api_version_fallback_ms                  |  *  | 0 .. 604800000     |       0      | Dictates how long the `broker_version_fallback` fallback is used in the case the ApiVersionRequest fails. **NOTE**: The ApiVersionRequest is only issued when a new connection to the broker is made (such as after an upgrade)
broker_version_fallback                  |  *  |                    |         0.10.0 | Older broker versions (<0.10.0) provides no way for a client to query for supported protocol features (ApiVersionRequest, see `api_version_request`) making it impossible for the client to know what features it may use. As a workaround a user may set this property to the expected broker version and the client will automatically adjust its feature set accordingly if the ApiVersionRequest fails (or is disabled). The fallback broker version will be used for `api_version_fallback_ms`. Valid values are: 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1, 0.8.0.
security.protocol                        |  *  | plaintext, ssl, sasl_plaintext, sasl_ssl |     plaintext | Protocol used to communicate with brokers

If this interval is exceeded the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another consumer group member. Warning: Offset commits may be not possible at this point. The interval is checked two times per second. See KIP-62 for more information.

Messages are fetched in batches by the consumer and if the first message batch in the first non-empty partition of the Fetch request is larger than this value, then the message batch will still be returned to ensure the consumer can make progress. The maximum message batch size accepted by the broker is defined via `message_max_bytes` (broker config) or `max_message_bytes` (broker topic config). `fetch_max_bytes` is automatically adjusted upwards to be at least `message_max_bytes` (consumer config).

Higher values will result in better compression at the cost of more CPU usage. Usable range is algorithm-dependent: [0-9] for gzip; [0-12] for lz4; only 0 for snappy; -1 = codec-dependent default compression level.
auto_commit_interval_ms                  |  C  | 10 .. 86400000  |         60000 | The frequency in milliseconds that the consumer offsets are committed (written) to offset storage. This setting is used by the low-level legacy consumer

This is functionally equivalent to the default partitioner in the Java Producer.).
offset_store_path                        |  C  |                 |             . | Path to local file for storing offsets. If the path is a directory a filename will be automatically generated in that directory based on the topic and partition
offset_store_sync_interval_ms            |  C  | -1 .. 86400000  |            -1 | fsync() interval for the offset file, in milliseconds. Use -1 to disable syncing, and 0 for immediate sync after each write
dispatch_mode                            |  C  | one_by_one, {batch, integer()}  |   one_by_one  | This field indicates how messages are dispatched to the message handler. One message per callback call (default) or multiple messages up to the specified size (batch). If the batch approach is used the consumer will mark as processed the last offset form the batch.
