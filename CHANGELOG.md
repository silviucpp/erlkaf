### Changelog:

#### v2.0.3

- Add support for poll_idle_ms topic setting.

#### v2.0.2

- Upgrade to librdkafka v1.6.1
- Add more supported configs from librdkafka.

#### v2.0.1

- Fix OTP 23 build
- Fix for https://github.com/silviucpp/erlkaf/issues/21
- Fix memory access

#### v2.0.0

- Redesign the callback system. Instead using one thread per consumer/producer that polls for new events, now it's 
using one single thread for all producers and consumers that's notified when new events are available.
- Breaking backward compatibility: change the `create_consumer_group` function parameters, and consumer configs. More details below.

##### Upgrading from v1.X to v2.0.0

In version 1.x each consumer group could handle a list of topics but it couldn't specify a callback for each topic. 
Now the callbacks settings moved into the topics list as follow:

```erlang

% v1.x

{client_consumer_id, [

    {type, consumer},

    {group_id, <<"erlkaf_consumer">>},
    {callback_module, test_consumer},
    {callback_args, []},
    {topics, [<<"topic1">>, <<"topic2">>]},
    {topic_options, [
        {auto_offset_reset, smallest}
    ]},
    {client_options, []}
]}

% becomes in v2.0.0 or newer:

{client_consumer_id, [

    {type, consumer},

    {group_id, <<"erlkaf_consumer">>},
    {topics, [
        {<<"topic1">>, [
            {callback_module, module_topic1},
            {callback_args, []}
        ]},
        {<<"topic2">>, [
            {callback_module, module_topic2},
            {callback_args, []}
        ]}
    ]},

    {topic_options, [
        {auto_offset_reset, smallest}
    ]},
    {client_options, []}
]}

% Please notice that `callback_module` and `callback_args` were moved into the `topics` which 
% now it's a proplist where key is the topic name and value is the list of settings for the topic.
